# DBContextBuilder


Uses the `Builder pattern` to create Entity Framework Core and classic `DbContext` instances
using an in-memory database for testing purposes. With DbContextBuilder, you can easily set up
a DbContext with predefined data, making it ideal for unit tests and integration tests without
having to rely on an actual database whose data can be changed or deleted over time
